### Features

-   **Frequency-Based Calculation:** Tune your car based on its desired dynamic response, not just its weight.
-   **Dual Damper Modes:** Includes calculations for both modern Race suspension (FH5, 1-20 range) and classic Off-road suspension (FH4, 1-10 range).
-   **Intelligent ARB Calculation:** Anti-roll bars are calculated proportionally to spring stiffness, weight distribution, and drivetrain type (RWD/FWD/AWD) to fine-tune handling balance.
-   **Aero Compensation:** Option to increase suspension stiffness to counteract aerodynamic downforce at high speeds.
-   **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface with a dark mode theme.

### How to Use

1.  **Enter Main Info:** Input your car's total weight, front weight balance (%), and available spring ranges from the in-game tuning menu.
2.  **Select Parameters:** Choose your target ride frequency. A lower value (e.g., 2.0 Hz) is softer and better for bumpy tracks, while a higher value (e.g., 2.8 Hz) is stiffer and more responsive for smooth surfaces. Adjust other modifiers as needed.
3.  **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" button.
4.  **Apply Settings:** Input the generated values into the tuning setup in Forza.
